# To run a job on Expanse:
# - Set the -J, --nodes, and -t options above, which correspond to job name,
#   number of nodes, and wall time limit in HH:MM:SS, respectively.
# - Set an `#SBATCH -A` argument for the computing account id.
# - Set the build directory, run directory, executable name,
#   and input file below.
# - For large jobs (multiple nodes), use -p compute and --ntasks-per-node 128
# - For small jobs (fewer than 128 procs), use -p shared set the number of
#   processors as --ntasks-per-node

# NOTE: The executable will not be copied from the build directory, so if you
#       update your build directory this file will use the updated executable.

# Optionally, if you need more control over how SpECTRE is launched on
# Expanse you can edit the launch command at the end of this file directly.

# directory, and to the directory where you want the output to appear, i.e. the
# run directory.
# E.g., if you cloned spectre in your home directory, set
# SPECTRE_BUILD_DIR to ${HOME}/spectre/build. If you want to run in a
# directory called "Run" in the current directory, set
# SPECTRE_RUN_DIR to ${PWD}/Run

# around 2k elements on 2 nodes.

#  - adjust the pemap to be a number of ranges equal to the number of comm
#    threads, and appropriate intervals of 128/number_of_comm_threads - 1
#  - adjust the commap to be a number of values equal to the number of comm
